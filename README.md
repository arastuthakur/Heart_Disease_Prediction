**Heart Disease Prediction Model**
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on several features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other medical factors. The model is built using a supervised learning algorithm and trained on a dataset of patients diagnosed with heart disease.

**Installation**
To run the model, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer along with the following libraries:

**NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib**
You can install these libraries using the following command:

**Copy code**
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

**Data**
The data used to train the model is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 303 instances with 14 features each. The features include age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other medical factors.

**Model**
The model used in this project is a logistic regression classifier. The model is trained on the dataset using a supervised learning approach. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

**Results**
The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set, with a precision of 84%, recall of 87%, and F1-score of 85%. These results indicate that the model is able to effectively predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on the input features.
